            Dao Duy Anh, DDA, was my middle school. In Vietnam, middle school will take 4 years from grade 6 to 9.
            At DDA, I met lots of friends who colored my childhood not to be boring and forgettable.
            At DDA, I joined the mathematics team to compete in the city math olympiad.
            I was a top and famous alumni there.

            Le Quy Don, LQD, was my high school. I stayed there for three years. I met my close friends there. We spent time studying, doing projects, and enjoying our youth.
            One thing that I regret the most of LQD is I did not make more friends. People there are amazing. I met my soulmate there. However, after I went to the US, we did not talk much.
            Now, we are only memory of each other. I pray her all the best. I am proud that now she could be independent without me. I'm so proud of you!!!
