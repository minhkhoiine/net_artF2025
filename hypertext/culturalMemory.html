        <p>In Vietnam, along with the Tet holiday, which we celebrate at the beginning of the lunar new year. We also celebrate Mid-autumn festival.
            We were told that there were two people living in the moon, every year, at that time, the full moon will be the most fulfilled moon of the whole year.
            Besides, enjoying the moonlight, children also went around their village with the lighted lanterns to celebrate. At school, we also celebrate Mid-autumn festival.
            Each class member would bring anything they had to share with the classmates and their teachers.
