        <h1>My childhood</h1>
        <p>My name is Khoi Vu. I was born in Saigon, Vietnam, where I spent 19 years before going to the US to study abroad.
        In Vietnam, it was so different from the US such as school, environment, and lifestyle.
        I remember, in Tet holiday, a traditional holiday in Vietnam, me and my parents went to a teacher to ask for a word so that I may use that word as my goal to achieve of that new year.
        He gave me the word "An". It means peaceful in mind. At that time, I realized that I had been competed with everyone a lot. I never had a moment for myself.
